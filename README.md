To-Do List Application
Overview

The To-Do List Application is a simple yet powerful tool built using Python's tkinter and customtkinter libraries. It allows users to manage their tasks effectively by adding, editing, and removing tasks, as well as setting due dates. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface that enhances task management.
Features

    Add Tasks: Users can enter tasks along with their due dates, which will be saved for future reference.
    Edit Tasks: By double-clicking on a task in the task list, users can edit the task text.
    Remove Tasks: Users can select and remove tasks they no longer need.
    Display Tasks: Tasks are displayed in a textbox along with their due dates for easy viewing.
    Save and Load Tasks: Tasks and their due dates are saved to a file (tasks.txt) and loaded automatically when the application starts.
    Due Date Reminders: The application checks if any tasks are due today or overdue and prompts a reminder message.
